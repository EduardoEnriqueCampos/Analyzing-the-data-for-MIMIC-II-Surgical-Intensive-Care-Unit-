In this repository, you'll find three files:

- "Campos.ipynb": This file contains the project's code, guiding you through each step of the analysis from data loading to the confusion matrix, displaying the output.

- "Campos_Documentation": This file provides a detailed explanation of the entire project. I recommend reviewing it to understand everything done in the coding part.

- The Excel file contains the dataset used for the analysis.
